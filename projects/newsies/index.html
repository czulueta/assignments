        <p> Nowadays, the majority of churches that follow the bible really don't. For example, most churches attend church on sunday.
        They also don't follow the laws, statues, and commandments of the most high god. Pastors say that the law is done
        away with and quote verses from the apostle Paul, such as "Romans 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall
        no flesh be justified in his sight: for the by the law is the knowledge of sin." But if take a deeper look into the
        bible we discover verses from christ himself stating facts such as,
        <span>"Matthew 5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
            18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the
            law, till all be fulfilled. 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach
            men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same
            shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven "</span>. Therefore according to christ the law is not done away
        with and whatever christ did we should follow his steps.</p>
